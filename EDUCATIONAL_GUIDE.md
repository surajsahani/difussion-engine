## How to Use in the Classroom

### For Teachers:
1. **Start the game**: `python -c "from proper_visual_game import ProperVisualGame; game = ProperVisualGame()"`
2. **Show target image**: Students see what they need to create
3. **Students write prompts**: Encourage descriptive language
4. **Compare results**: Discuss what words work best
5. **Celebrate learning**: Focus on improvement and creativity

### Sample Student Prompts:
- "red house with yellow door"
- "colorful rainbow in blue sky"  
- "orange cat with pink nose"
- "green tree with red apples"
- "blue car with black wheels"

### Learning Objectives:
- **Descriptive language**: Using adjectives and specific terms
- **Visual analysis**: Breaking down images into components
- **Creative thinking**: Finding different ways to describe the same thing
- **Technical concepts**: Understanding how AI responds to language
- **Iterative improvement**: Learning from feedback
