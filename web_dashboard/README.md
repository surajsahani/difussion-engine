## üöÄ Deployment Options

### Local Development
```bash
python run_dashboard.py
# Runs on http://localhost:8080
```

### Production Deployment
```bash

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Dashboard won't start**
```bash
# Make sure ai-prompt-game is installed
pip install ai-prompt-game
ai-prompt-game --setup
```

**Images not loading**
```bash
# Check if target images exist
ls ~/.ai-prompt-game/targets/
# Should show: cat.jpg, coffee.jpg, car.jpg, etc.
```

**Generation fails**
```bash
# Check internet connection (uses Pollinations.ai)
# Try with a simple prompt first
```

**Scores seem wrong**
```bash
# This is normal - the v2.0 algorithm is much stricter
# Focus on detailed, accurate descriptions
```

## üìà Performance Tips

### For Better Scores
- **Be specific** about colors, lighting, and composition
- **Describe the style** (realistic, cartoon, artistic, etc.)
- **Mention the background** and setting details
- **Include object positions** and relationships
- **Iterate based on AI feedback**

### For Better Performance
- **Use shorter prompts** for faster generation
- **Close other browser tabs** for smoother experience
- **Refresh page** if images stop loading
- **Check network connection** for generation issues
