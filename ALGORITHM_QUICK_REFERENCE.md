# 🎯 Quick Reference: 4-Algorithm Rating System

## 📋 **Algorithm Summary**

| Algorithm | Weight | What It Measures | Quick Tip |
|-----------|--------|------------------|-----------|
| 🏗️ **Structural** | **30%** | Layout & composition | Describe the overall arrangement |
| 🎨 **Histogram** | **25%** | Color distribution | Mention color mood & intensity |
| 🔲 **Edges** | **25%** | Shapes & boundaries | Describe important shapes & textures |
| 🌈 **Colors** | **20%** | Dominant color themes | Name specific main colors |

---

## 🧮 **Score Calculation Formula**

```
Final Score = (Structural × 0.30) + (Histogram × 0.25) + (Edges × 0.25) + (Colors × 0.20)
```

## ⚡ **Example: "ok" vs "aurora borealis"**

### Prompt: "ok"
- 🏗️ Structural: 85% ✅ (horizontal layout matches)
- 🎨 Histogram: 6% ❌ (wrong colors entirely)
- 🔲 Edges: 92% ✅ (clean geometric lines)
- 🌈 Colors: 81% ✅ (some white overlap)
- **Final: 66%** 🤔

### Prompt: "aurora borealis northern lights green purple sky"
- 🏗️ Structural: 92% ✅ (perfect layout)
- 🎨 Histogram: 89% ✅ (correct color distribution)
- 🔲 Edges: 88% ✅ (matching organic curves)
- 🌈 Colors: 95% ✅ (exact color themes)
- **Final: 91%** 🎉

**Lesson**: Specific, descriptive prompts that address all visual aspects score much higher!
