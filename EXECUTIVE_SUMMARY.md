# 🎯 AI Reverse Prompt Engineering Game
## Executive Summary - Hackathon Project

---

## 🚀 **The Big Idea**
**"What if students learned AI prompt engineering by reverse-engineering beautiful images?"**

We built an **AI-powered educational game** where students see a target image and must craft prompts to recreate it. It's like playing "guess the prompt" but with real AI image generation!

---

## 🎮 **How It Works in 30 Seconds**
1. **Student sees**: Beautiful mountain sunset photo
2. **Student writes**: "landscape photo" 
3. **AI generates**: Basic landscape (Score: 23%)
4. **Student refines**: "golden sunset over mountain peaks"
5. **AI generates**: Much closer match (Score: 82%)
6. **Victory!** Student learned effective prompt engineering

## 🎯 **Live Demo Script**

### **"Let me show you how a student learns prompt engineering..."**

1. **Target**: *[Show beautiful mountain sunset]*
2. **First Try**: "landscape" → *[Show basic result]* → **Score: 0.234**
3. **Learning**: "Hmm, needs more detail about colors and time of day"
4. **Second Try**: "sunset over mountains" → *[Better result]* → **Score: 0.567** 
5. **Refining**: "Getting closer! What about the dramatic sky?"
6. **Victory Try**: "golden sunset over mountain peaks with dramatic clouds" → **Score: 0.823** ✅

### **"In 3 attempts, they learned effective prompt engineering!"**
